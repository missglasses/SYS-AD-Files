## What is a Server?

- A **server** is a computer system that provides services to other computers (called **clients**).  
- **Clients** can connect through the **internet** or a **local area network (LAN)**.  


## Main Components of a Server
- Motherboard  
- CPU  
- Memory (RAM)  
- Hard Drive / Storage  
- Network Connection  
- Power Supply  



## Server Environment
- Installed in an **exclusive environment** like a server room.  
- Requires **air conditioning** to maintain temperature.  
- Placed on **server racks** that can stack multiple servers.  



## How It Works (Request‚ÄìResponse Model)
1. Client sends a **request** via the network.  
2. Server **receives** the request.  
3. Server **processes** the request and provides the information.  
4. Server ensures the client is **authenticated** before access.

## Real-Life Examples & Types of Servers

**Web Server**

  *Example:* - When a user types a URL in the browser:

   **Browser** asks the **DNS server** for the IP address.  
    - **Browser** sends an **HTTP request** to the web server using that IP.  
    - **Web server** processes it and sends back the webpage.  
    - **Browser** displays the content.

- **Database Server** ‚Äì Stores and manages databases.  
  *Example:* A bank uses a database server to store customer account records.  

- **Application Server** ‚Äì Runs applications for clients.  
  *Example:* A company runs an HR payroll system on an application server accessible by employees.  

- **Fax Server** ‚Äì Handles fax transmissions.  
  *Example:* A law firm sends and receives digital faxes through a centralized fax server.  

- **File Server** ‚Äì Stores and shares files.

- **Media Server** ‚Äì Streams audio/video content.  
  *Example:* Netflix uses media servers to stream movies and shows to users worldwide.  

- **Print Server** ‚Äì Manages printers in a network.  
  *Example:* A university uses a print server to control access to shared printers for students.  

- **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** ‚Äì Virtualized server for isolated hosting.  
  *Example:* A small business rents a VPS to host its e-commerce website.
